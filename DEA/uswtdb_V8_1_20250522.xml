      <abstract>This dataset provides locations and technical specifications of wind turbines in the United States, almost all of which are utility-scale. Utility-scale turbines are ones that generate power and feed it into the grid, supplying a utility with energy. They are usually much larger than turbines that would feed a house or business. The regularly updated database contains wind turbine records that have been collected, digitized, and locationally verified. Turbine data were gathered from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Digital Obstacle File (DOF) and Obstruction Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA), American Clean Power (ACP) Association (formerly American Wind Energy Association (AWEA)), Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL), and the United States Geological Survey (USGS), and were merged and collapsed into a single dataset. Verification of the turbine positions was done by visual interpretation using high-resolution aerial imagery in ESRI ArcGIS Desktop. A locational error of plus or minus 10 meters for turbine locations was tolerated. Technical specifications for turbines were assigned based on the wind turbine make and models as provided by manufacturers and project developers directly, and via FAA datasets, information on the wind project developer or turbine manufacturer websites, or other online sources. Some facility and turbine information on make and model did not exist or was difficult to obtain. Thus, uncertainty may exist for certain turbine specifications. Similarly, some turbines were not yet built, not built at all, or for other reasons cannot be verified visually. Location and turbine specifications data quality are rated, and a confidence level (1 to 3) is recorded for both. None of the data are field verified.</abstract>
      <purpose>The purpose of this information is to provide a regularly updated, publicly available, spatially referenced, national dataset made up of utility-scale wind turbine locations and their technical specifications. An appropriate use of the data would be for scientific analysis, research, or for general interest for the public.</purpose>
      <supplinf>Compressed files provided within this data release are in in ESRI shapefile format. The user must have software capable of uncompressing the file and displaying the shapefile. In lieu of ArcGIS, the user may utilize another GIS application package capable of importing the data.</supplinf>

    <attracc>
      <attraccr>Turbine data points were spatially verified using aerial imagery to confirm or edit their correct positions. The map scale used while verifying and digitizing turbines depended on location, need, and imagery availability. Authors used aerial imagery with a typical assessment map scale of 1:2,000 to 1:5,000. None of the spatial verification was done at a map scale smaller than 1:5,000. Uncertainty may exist for certain turbine "locations" as indicated in the confidence turbine location field (t_conf_loc). Uncertainty in turbine "specifications" is indicated in the confidence of attribute field (t_conf_atr).</attraccr>

    <complete>This dataset is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. It is regularly updated (typically quarterly) to add and remove turbines. Characteristics and turbines specifications may be altered over time. Users should be aware that the location data was based on a snapshot in time; turbines could have been removed after that time or built since the image date presented. Users are advised to read the metadata record carefully for additional details. None of the data are field verified.</complete>
    <posacc>
      <horizpa>
        <horizpar>The wind turbine points were horizontally verified with aerial imagery as specified in the image source attribute. NAIP provides 1-meter ground sample distance orthoimagery to within plus or minus six meters to true ground at a 95-percent confidence level. The Bing Maps Aerial basemaps and Maxar (formerly Digital Globe) imagery have a variable resolution and accuracy based on image source, type, and location. The Bing Maps Aerial basemaps horizontal accuracy for CONUS is estimated to be 0.3 meters to 0.03 meters. Maxar imagery is estimated to be 0.3 meters to 0.03 meters.</horizpar>

      <procstep>
        <procdesc>Prior to the steps listed below, United States wind turbines were identified, mapped, and verified by the USGS for a separate dataset: 'Onshore Industrial Wind Turbine Locations for the United States to March 2014'. A description of the process to develop that dataset can be found in the metadata file for that release (https://doi.org/10.5066/F7251G8Q). Building off this earlier effort, the following steps were taken to expand and update the United States Wind Turbine Database (USWTDB) with the collaboration between the USGS, LBNL, and ACP (formerly AWEA). Please note that some steps are iterated on a quarterly basis to keep the dataset current. For additional information, see 'A continuously updated, geospatially rectified database of utility-scale wind turbines in the United States' https://doi.org/10.1038/s41597-020-0353-6. 

(1) The March 2014 USGS dataset containing 48,956 turbines, 34,864 of which had unique FAA Obstacle Repository System (ORS) numbers, was merged with the LBNL wind turbine dataset.
(2) The LBNL dataset had previously existed separately in-house and had the FAA ORS number as well as many of the same fields as the USGS dataset. It was merged into the USGS dataset using the ORS number, bringing in LBNL fields and IDs. 
(3) Non-matching LBNL turbines were also added as LBNL-only turbines.
(4) The most recent FAA Digital Obstacle File (DOF) was downloaded and filtered for "windmills", and reprojected from WGS-84, as FAA provided it, to NAD-83 datum, the USGS and LBNL datum. These new coordinates were used later in the process.
(5) The DOF dataset was then merged into the working USWTDB using the ORS number, keeping new (non-matching) DOF-only turbines, and DOF variables (faa_aglht, faa_amslht, faa_asn, ylat, xlong). 
(6) The most recent FAA Obstacle Evaluation Airport Airspace Analysis (OE-AAA) file was downloaded and filtered for "windmills".
(7) The OE-AAA dataset was merged into working USWTDB using the Aeronautical Study Number (ASN) and preserved as the faa_asn attribute, keeping new (non-matching) turbines as OE-only and OE-AAA variables (oe_builtdate, oe_appdate, oe_expdate, oe_comdate, notice of, status, dtrmntn, oe_aglht, ylat, xlong). 
(8) The latest ACP WindIQ turbine dataset was downloaded. 
(9) A geospatial match between ACP turbines and the working USWTDB was performed using the "geonear" command in Stata statistical analysis software and the following steps: [a] Save separate ACP and working USWTDB datasets. [b] Run the "geonear" command in Stata between the two datasets to determine and "match" nearest neighbors (i.e., these turbines are suspected to be the same turbine but from the two different datasets) and calculate the distance between them. [c] Calculate differences in the installed year, hub height, rotor diameter, and total height between "matched" turbine pairs. [d] Accept "match" (meaning assume they are, in fact, the same turbine) IF the distance between pairs is zero (perfect geospatial match), OR the distance between pairs is less than 100 feet (30.5 m) and hub height, rotor diameter, and installed year are equal between the pairs. If the match criteria were not met, both turbines in the pair were saved for subsequent visual inspection and for the "manual" confirmation of the match. Non-matching ACP turbines were added to the dataset as ACP-only turbines, and all ACP variables (turbine ID, p_year, t_cap, t_hh, t_rd, t_ttlh, ylat, xlong, t_manu, t_model, t_state, t_retrofit, t_retro_yr, as well as other variables) were added to the dataset. 
(10) A hierarchy was developed because multiple datasets contain some of the same fields (e.g., t_ttlh was contained in USGS, LBNL, DOF, OE-AAA, and ACP datasets) Because LBNL and ACP data are sourced from two high-quality sources (OEMs and developers) and reconciled to eliminate differences, LBNL data is the primary source for turbine attributes and turbine project characteristics, followed by ACP, USGS, DOF, and finally OE-AAA. In the overwhelming majority of cases, differences between sources were minimal, but when discrepancies existed, that order was used to populate fields. All fields that are missing from higher-order sources are populated from lower sources. 
(11) The working (i.e., fully merged) USWTDB was spatially joined with base layers via ArcMap in order to pin t_state, t_county, and t_fips to turbine points. 
(12) Turbine points were selected by state, saved as individual turbine files for each state, and distributed to authors for editing. 
(13) A basemap image from Maxar (formerly Digital Globe) was added to the ArcMap project file. If Digital Globe imagery did not show a turbine installation, USDA/NAIP County Mosaic Orthoimagery or Google Earth imagery was cross-checked. Previous Bing map image source was retained for some of the previous USGS data. 
(14) Turbine points were visually verified and edited/moved to the base of the turbine as needed with an estimated tolerance of 10 meters. 
(15) If the turbine data point was not seen on an image, the t_conf_loc was entered as 1. If the turbine point was in partial construction or had other doubts, the t_conf_loc was entered as 2. If a turbine was clearly seen on an image, the t_conf_loc was entered as 3. Turbines that have not yet been visually verified are labeled with 0 in t_conf_loc. 
(16) Turbine points that had existed previously but were since decommissioned and removed were flagged as decommissioned and later removed (see step 20). 
(17) Duplicate turbine points (largely resulting from ACP geospatial merge) were identified, and t_img_date, and t_img_src  were attributed for each turbine. 
(18) Non-turbine points that had been assigned FAA Obstacle Repository System (ORS) numbers or were digitized in the process, such as communications towers, meteorological towers, water windmills, power transmission towers, etc., were removed.  
(19) Edited wind turbine files for each state were merged into one single shapefile. Turbines identified as duplicates were matched, all fields were collapsed into a single turbine observation, and duplicate points were removed.  
(20) Turbines flagged as decommissioned were removed.
(21) QA/QC was conducted for spatial accuracy and attribution by a peer or a supervisor other than the author who initially completed the work. As noted above, steps 4-21 are repeated on a quarterly basis, using the most recent USWTDB as the starting point. 
(22) Starting with version 2_3, an additional attribute of the eia_id 860 plant code was added to allow users to correlate to EIA 860 data. The plant codes were initially matched to ACP base data when available and provided by ACP. The incomplete values were matched manually based on project name, year, turbine make/model, state, county, etc. 
(23) Starting with version 3_3, two additional attributes were added.  The attributes retrofit (later renamed t_retrofit) and t_retro_yr included ACP data to identify turbines that have been partially retrofitted (i.e., new rotor blades and/or nacelles on existing towers) and the year the retrofit occurred. This information is derived from ACP's WindIQ database. 
(24) An additional attribute named t_offshore was added with version 7_0 to identify turbines that are located offshore. 
(25) Lastly, a CSV of the data was exported, a changelog was created, and a data dictionary defining the entities and attributes was included; all are available for download with this data release.</procdesc>
